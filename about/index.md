I am a Back-end developer with a fashion and design background. After graduating from fashion school, I worked in the clothing development room, but I guess I just wanted to <strong>develop</strong> it.
I really liked games since I was young. As a result, interest in game servers has increased, and I want to study 'server' more deeply, and I am also very interested in SQL. I started developing in November 2021, and I will grow and strive to become a "Developer you want to work with."
